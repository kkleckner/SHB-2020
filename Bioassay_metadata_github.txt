This is the metadata for Bioassay_data_github.csv

For each column:

Header | Description


Round | Round number. Bioassays performed on the same day. 
        Only data from one round was used for calculating LC50 values for each compound.

Analysis | Denotes if data was used in the calcultion of LC50 or not. Y - yes; N - no

Date | Calendar date bioassays were started and compounds were administered.

Treatment | Treatment group of experimental cage. "Negative" denotes negative control 
            where nothing was added to the pollen.

Solution_ug_ul | Concentration of solution mixed into 0.1 g pollen ball. 
                 Micrograms of compound diluted in microliters of acetone.

Solid_ug_g | Amount of compound in solid 0.1 g pollen ball.
             Micrograms of compound in grams of pollen ball.

Replicate | Replicate number. Each replicate constituted a single experimental cage.

Treated | Number of adult small hive beetles (SHBs) treated inside each replicate/experimental cage.

4hr_Mort | Total number of adult SHBs dead at 4 hours post compound application.

24hr_Mort | Total number of adult SHBs dead at 24 hours post compound application. 
                 Includes SHBs dead at 4 hour check.

48hr_Mort | Total number of adult SHBs dead at 48 hours post compound application. 
                 Includes SHBs dead at 4 and 24 hour checks.

72hr_Mort | Total number of adult SHBs dead at 72 hours post compound application. 
                 Includes SHBs dead at 4, 24, and 48 hour checks.

Notes | Additonal comments on data.
